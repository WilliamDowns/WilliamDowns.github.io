I chose to report on "The impact of social media on informal learning in museums" by Angelina Russo, Jerry Watkins, & Susan Groundwater-Smith (2009).
This paper, written at a time when the significance of social media was being realized, focuses on how museums can harness new forms of "informal learning" brought about by social media (155).
Because social media is, well, social, it challenges the concept of one-directional learning in which there is a single all-knowledgable source. 
Museum culture has moved further and further away from this primitive model over the centuries (159), but not to the extent of the completely participatory model of social media.
This peer-to-peer learning model is increasingly integral to young people (157). In fact, several museums were already experimenting with technological environments for participatory learning at the time of this paper's writing (159).
The world of this participatory model and the world of the traditional formal learning model are not incompatible so long as they respect each other. (158)
Overall, because social media-based learning environments allow users to share their opinions and to develop meaningful connections between their experiences and others' (161), these environments encourage visitors to return and connect further with the museum (163).
