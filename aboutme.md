subtitle: A Human Computer Interaction Student

My name is William Downs. I attend Williams College as a Computer Science and Geosciences Major, planning to graduate in 2019. I made this page to hold my individual design documents from my Human Computer Interaction class. A link to my design group's page is provided on the main page and [here](https://nsang0u.github.io/amarteurs/).
